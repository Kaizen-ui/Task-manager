Go Lang Project-Based Learning: Arrays and Slices (Beginner Level)
Project Title: Daily & Weekly Task Manager

Problem Statement
Build a program to manage tasks for a day (using a fixed array) and a week (using a slice). Avoid loops and focus on direct index operations.

Part 1: Daily Tasks (Arrays)
Concept Focus:

Array declaration, initialization, and fixed-size constraints.

Accessing/modifying elements by index.

Tasks:

Declare a fixed-size array dailyTasks to store 5 tasks (strings) for a day.

Initialize the array with 3 tasks:

Index 0: "Wake up"

Index 1: "Eat breakfast"

Index 2: "Work"

Perform the following operations:

Add "Read a book" at index 3.

Replace the task at index 4 with "Exercise".

Print all tasks by explicitly accessing each index (e.g., dailyTasks[0], dailyTasks[1]).

Key Questions:

What happens if you try to add a task at index 5? Why?

Part 2: Weekly Tasks (Slices)
Concept Focus:

Slice declaration, dynamic resizing with append(), and index-based operations.

Tasks:

Create an empty slice weeklyTasks.

Dynamically add tasks in this order:

"Plan week"

"Grocery shopping"

"Call family"

"Cook dinner"

"Write journal"

Remove the task at index 2 ("Call family").

Insert "Relax" between "Cook dinner" (now index 2) and "Write journal" (index 3).

Hint: Use append() to split and combine the slice.

Combine the dailyTasks array with the weeklyTasks slice into a new slice weeklySummary.

Print:

The first 3 tasks in weeklyTasks (by accessing indices 0, 1, 2).

The total number of tasks in weeklySummary (use len()).

Key Questions:

How does the slice’s capacity change after inserting/removing tasks?

Learning Outcomes
By completing this project, you’ll understand:

Arrays: Fixed size and direct index manipulation.

Slices: Dynamic resizing with append(), index-based operations, and combining arrays/slices.

Key Differences: When to use arrays (fixed data) vs. slices (dynamic data).

Example Output:

Copy
Daily Tasks:  
[0] Wake up  
[1] Eat breakfast  
[2] Work  
[3] Read a book  
[4] Exercise  

Weekly Tasks (First 3):  
[0] Plan week  
[1] Grocery shopping  
[2] Relax  

Weekly Summary Total Tasks: 9
